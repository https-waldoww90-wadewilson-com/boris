## Installation

To install Boris, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `boris` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
1.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/webdna/boris.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
1. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
